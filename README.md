# Gym Training app

The Gym Training app is a simple application for executing the daily workout.
If you have a list of exercises that you follow each day, you can use the app for storage its data, like the exercise name and the number of repetions and sets. Then, when you go training, just add the weight that you get on that training to use it as a stating weight in the next execution other day.

Example: 
I follow a 3 day workout, that includes one day for back (pullups, seated row, etc), one day for chest (bench press, pushups, etc) and one day for legs (squats).
With the Gym Training app, I create 3 trainings (one for each day) and its exercises for each one, then when I go to the gym, I just execute that workout that I created before (chest, as example), fill with the weight that I get and finish. The next day I will execute the chest training it will show the last weight that I get.

There's a calendar function that allows to see the last workouts

Charts with the evolution of the weights in each trainig will be implemented soon
